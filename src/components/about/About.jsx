        I am a passionate software developer, a Full-Stack and react Developer.
        I graduated from Sel√ßuk University Faculty of Law, but I turned to this
        field after realizing how excited I was about software. I became a
        Full-Stack Developer with a comprehensive one-year training program.

        In backend development, I design secure and efficient applications using
        powerful technologies such as Java, SQL, and Spring Boot. In the front
        end, I like to create user-friendly, fluid interfaces with React and
        Next.js. It is very important to me to keep the user experience at the
        forefront of every project.

      <p className="text-xl  w-[80%]  text-justify">
        Technology is not just a job for me; it is also a passion. I am
        motivated by creating innovative solutions, simplifying complex
        problems, and constantly learning. In addition, values such as justice
        and equality are still very important to me. Therefore, with my interest
        in these subjects, I do research and develop projects, especially in
        information technology law.

      <p className="text-xl  w-[80%]  text-justify">
        My future goal is to lead a team as a senior developer and inspire the
        next generation of software developers. If you would like to collaborate
        on projects or exchange ideas, please do not hesitate to contact me!
